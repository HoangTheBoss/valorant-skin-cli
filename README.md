## Installation and usage
### Installation
__Download the `.exe` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/colinhartigan/valorant-skin-cli/releases/latest) page and run it!__

__NOTE__: Your antivirus might mark the executable as malware, but this is a side effect of building the executable with PyInstaller. 
_I've rebuilt the executables with Python 3.7 and it seems they aren't being marked as malware anymore!_

If you'd rather build the executable yourself, download the release `.zip` file and run `build.bat`, or `run.bat` to execute the script directly.

To test the latest features, clone the repository.

### Usage
Check out the [commands page](https://github.com/colinhartigan/valorant-skin-cli/wiki/Commands) in the Wiki.


## Will I get banned for using this?
[u/Riot_Giraffy confirmed:](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/oae5g6/i_got_tired_of_waiting_for_riot_to_add_a_skin/)
> Using the client API to modify loadouts does not seem ban worthy. The client API isn't officially supported for third party use, so don't expect future compatibility.


## What's next
- [ ] loadout creator
  - [ ] loadout randomizer
- [ ] spray randomizer 
- [ ] gun buddy randomizer
